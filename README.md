# MTG ______ Goblin Randomizer
This project aims to improve the UX of randomizing your sticker cards; I wasn't a fan of the existing solutions because they didn't let you know how much mana you got at a glance and I also wanted to go for something a bit more modern.

## Contributing
Go ahead if you want! I don't intend this project's scope to be much wider than the current implementation, but I'm open to visual changes and bugfixes.
